## Gameplay

In The Real Life, the player must push boxes to their designated locations on the map. The player can move their character up, down, left, or right using the arrow keys. The player can not pull boxes, and they can not move through walls or boxes. If the player successfully pushes all the boxes to their designated locations, they win the level.

There are multiple levels available in The Real Life, and the player can progress to the next level by completing the current one. The player can also select a different level from the main menu if they want to skip ahead or revisit a previous level.

Good luck and have fun!
